# forgotten_scripts

This backdoor is an old draft that I decided to share. Don't expect perfects results if you plan to us it "as it".

In order to use my malware toolkit you have first to install the ASCIIexzor suit. 
Once it has been done, you can run two scripts :

* ASCIIexzorShell -a (victim arch) -h (host listener) -p (listener port [1337 - 50000]) [optional args][-v (varname) -k (xor key) (partially broken)]
* ASCIIexzorShell-Test -a (arch) [optional args][-v (varname) -k (xor key) (partially broken)]

My youtube video ( in french ) should give a clue how to use my malware toolkit. 
Of course, this draft is just for testing purpose. If you are a kind of "white hat" or something like this, It should be enough.
If on the contrary you are a real "hacker". You already know you can't rely on metasploit for evil activities but at least, my backdoor template should be a good starting :)
